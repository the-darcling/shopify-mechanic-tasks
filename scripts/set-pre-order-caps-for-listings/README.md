### Personal note

One of the two tasks I'm very proud to have written in a single evening. Prior to us using Mechanic for managing the pre-order settings for listings, we were using an app from the Shopify app store (the name of which I will not disclose for ethical reasons). The app suddenly stopped working in the middle of a sale, and so I quickly needed to uninstall the app, and write this automation from scratch.

It has since undergone many iterations, but the base logic stayed the same â™¡
