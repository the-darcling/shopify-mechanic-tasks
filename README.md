# Shopify Mechanic Tasks

Tasks I've written for Lightward's Shopify app, Mechanic.

## Dear reviewerâ€”

All Mechanic tasks I've created here are proprietary; they were created for my current company, and have not been ported for public use. These automations are live on our website, and are being used for various tasks on our admin dashboard, such as order fulfillment, and listing management.

Each task in this repository is a task that I have written from scratch, most of which within a very small time frame. I have used [no pre-existing Mechanic task](https://github.com/lightward/mechanic-tasks/tree/main/docs) as a template.

These tasks use Liquid logic, GraphQL mutations and queries, and Mechanic Liquid filters.
